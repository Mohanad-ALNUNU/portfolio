      <h2>2023 - Bookstore API</h2>
      <p>
        In the year 2023, I embarked on the creation of a dynamic and versatile RESTful API tailored for a bookstore. This project stands as a testament to my capability to design and implement APIs that facilitate diverse operations associated with books, authors, and categories.

      <p>
        Central to the Bookstore API is the utilization of the JavaSpark framework, which empowers the creation of lightweight and efficient web services. I designed endpoints that enable users to execute a range of operations, from fetching book information to managing authors and categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        MongoDB, a robust and flexible NoSQL database, underpins the API's data storage and retrieval mechanisms. By harnessing the power of MongoDB, the API ensures seamless handling of data related to books, authors, and categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        JSON serves as the primary data interchange format, facilitating smooth communication between the API and various client applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        To provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API, I designed and integrated an Angular-based front end. This allows users to effortlessly perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books, authors, and categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bookstore API project underscores my commitment to crafting solutions that embody best practices in software development, promote data integrity, and provide a seamless user experience.
