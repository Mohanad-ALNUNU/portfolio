      <h2>2023 - E-commerce Website</h2>
      <p>
        In 2023, I embarked on the creation of a robust and feature-rich e-commerce website, representing a significant milestone in my development journey. The result is an immersive platform that empowers users to effortlessly browse products, assemble their cart, and securely place orders, fostering a seamless online shopping experience.

      <p>
        The cornerstone of this project lies in the Spring Boot framework, which underpins the robust backend architecture of the e-commerce website. Leveraging Spring Boot's capabilities, I ensured the secure handling of user interactions, product management, and order processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        MongoDB serves as the database solution, facilitating efficient data storage, retrieval, and management, ensuring scalability to accommodate the e-commerce platform's growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The integration of Swagger bolsters the project's documentation and visualization, promoting transparency and ease of understanding for collaborators and future developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure the platform's resilience and reliability, I meticulously implemented unit tests using the Mockito and JUnit 5 frameworks. This approach enhances code quality and fosters confidence in the application's functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Containerization using Docker further streamlines deployment, enabling the website to be hosted seamlessly across various environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The E-commerce Website project exemplifies my dedication to delivering solutions that marry cutting-edge technologies with user-centric design, fostering a secure and enjoyable online shopping experience.
