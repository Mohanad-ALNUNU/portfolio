      <h2>2022 - Architectural Gallery</h2>
      <p>
        Created an immersive 3D architectural website that provides users with a user-friendly platform to explore intricate building designs and urban plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website features three distinct modules, each showcasing unique architectural projects and an urban plan, all carefully designed to highlight the intricate details of the structures.
      </p>

        The live site for the project can be accessed at: <a href="https://yip.su/archi_gallary" style="text-decoration: underline;">Click to access to live project</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The project leverages a technical environment including THREE-JS, SketchUp, Blender, and Photoshop to deliver a visually stunning and interactive experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user-friendly website was developed using Three.js, with the 3D architectural modules meticulously crafted and refined in Blender and SketchUp.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure a seamless user experience, a smooth navigation system was implemented, allowing users to explore the modules effortlessly using next and previous buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user experience was further enhanced by integrating three control modes: Orbit mode (default), FPS mode, and Fly mode, offering users multiple ways to interact with the architectural designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        An information window was implemented to provide precise details about the buildings. Users can click on a building to access comprehensive information about its structure and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project successfully features three modules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Module 1: Consisting of four distinct buildings.</li>
        <li>Module 2: Showcasing a unique and specific building.</li>
        <li>Module 3: Created as an urban plan, highlighting a city composed of numerous buildings.</li>
      </ul>
