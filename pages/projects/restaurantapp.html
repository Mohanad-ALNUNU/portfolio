      <h2>2021 - RESTAURANTAPP</h2>
      <p>
        As a freelance project, I developed a comprehensive Flutter application designed for managing meals, while also offering users the ability to search and filter meals based on their nutritional values.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app provides users with the essential functionality to create, track, and search meals, ensuring a user-friendly experience that caters to their dietary preferences and nutritional needs.

      <p>
        The application was developed using the Flutter framework, known for its cross-platform compatibility and smooth user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users have the capability to create and manage their meals, including essential nutritional information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is equipped with powerful search and filtering features, enabling users to find meals that match their dietary preferences and nutritional goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user-friendly interface ensures an intuitive navigation experience, making it easy for users to interact with the app and manage their meals effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The RESTAURANTAPP serves as an example of my proficiency in Flutter development and my commitment to providing practical and valuable solutions to clients.
